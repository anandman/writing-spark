# Writing Spark ✨

A distraction-free "Oblique Strategies" tool for kids. It helps students overcome writer's block in Chinese and English writing assignments using a visual, sensory-friendly interface.

## Features

*   **Two Modes:**
    *   **Chinese Sentence Expander:** Nudges to help stretch simple sentences into 15+ character requirements.
    *   **English Story Helper:** Narrative prompts to sustain flow for long writing assignments.
*   **Visual "Time Timer":** A red disk that shrinks clockwise as time passes, providing a concrete, non-digital sense of remaining time.
*   **Side-by-Side Layout:** Optimized for landscape iPads and Chromebooks to keep prompts and timers clearly separated.
*   **Ultra-Dim Zen Mode (🌙):** A one-tap "blanking" mode that turns the screen black, showing only a very faint, ghostly red timer wedge to minimize computer distraction while writing.
*   **Looping Timer:** Automatically resets and chimes when time is up to maintain a productive rhythm.

## How to Use
